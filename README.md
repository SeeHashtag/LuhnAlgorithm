# LuhnAlgorithm
Created with VBA. This is an implementation of the Luhn Algorithm or Mod 10 Algorithm for validating credit card numbers.

This macro will generate the 16th digit of a credit card when provided with the first 15 digits. It is used with Excel files and best implemented as an Auto_Open() macro.

Details about this algorithm from Wikipedia: 
"The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is specified in ISO/IEC 7812-1.[1] It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers."
